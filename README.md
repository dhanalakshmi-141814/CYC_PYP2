 Task 2: Basic Calculator CLI

This is a simple Python command-line calculator using `input()` to interact with the user.

 Features:

- Division (with division-by-zero handling)

 How It Works:
The program prompts the user to:
1. Enter the first number
2. Choose an operation (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`)
3. Enter the second number

Then it performs the operation and displays the result.

 Sample Run:

Enter first number: 5
Enter operation (add, sub, mul, div): mul
Enter second number: 3
Result: 15.0
